Reformat the following text into meeting minutes.  
- Start with the meeting date, time, and location (if applicable).  
- List the attendees and absentees.  
- Summarize the key points discussed, decisions made, and action items assigned.  
- For each action item, include the person responsible and any relevant deadlines.  
- Ensure the format is clear and easy to follow, using bullet points or numbered lists where necessary.

Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

Reformat the following text into a formal press release.  
- Start with a headline that summarizes the news in a clear, attention-grabbing way.  
- Include a subheadline for further context or details.  
- Follow with the body, including the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the announcement.  
- Ensure the tone is professional and objective.  
- End with a contact section and company boilerplate.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

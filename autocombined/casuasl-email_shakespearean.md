Reformat the following text into a casual email message.  
- Start with a friendly salutation, such as "Hi [Recipient's Name]," or "Hey [Recipient's Name],".  
- Ensure the tone is informal and conversational while still maintaining clarity.  
- Improve the text for readability and flow.  
- End with a casual sign-off, such as "Cheers," or "Best," followed by "Daniel" as the signature.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

Reformat the following text into a summary of meeting notes.  
- Start with the date and time of the meeting.  
- List key discussion points, decisions made, and action items.  
- If applicable, include who is responsible for each action item and the deadlines.  
- Ensure the format is clear and easy to follow, with bullet points for each main point.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

Reformat the following text into a system prompt for an AI assistant.  
- Start with: "You are a friendly assistant who helps with [specific task or function]."  
- Define the assistant's role clearly, outlining what it should focus on.  
- Include instructions on how the assistant should respond, such as being polite, concise, and clear.  
- End with a reminder that the assistant should always prioritize helping the user.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

Reformat the following text into a README file for a GitHub repository.  
- Start with the project title and a short description of what it does.  
- Include installation instructions, dependencies, and how to run the software.  
- Provide examples of how to use the software, including command-line arguments or function calls.  
- Include any necessary configuration steps, if applicable.  
- End with a section on contributing, licensing, and contact information.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

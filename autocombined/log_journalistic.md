- Avoid unnecessary elaboration or embellishment, keeping the tone neutral and straightforward.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.

- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

Reformat the following text into a system prompt for an AI assistant.  
- Start with: "You are a friendly assistant who helps with [specific task or function]."  
- Define the assistant's role clearly, outlining what it should focus on.  
- Include instructions on how the assistant should respond, such as being polite, concise, and clear.  
- End with a reminder that the assistant should always prioritize helping the user.


Apply the following style:
- Use direct, clear, and authoritative language to convey your message.  
- Avoid hedging or uncertaintyâ€”make the statement or request strong and unambiguous.  
- Ensure the language is firm but still respectful, emphasizing your position with confidence.  
- Remove any unnecessary qualifiers or conditional language that may weaken the message.

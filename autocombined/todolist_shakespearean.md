Reformat the following text into a JSON to-do list.  
- Think of an appropriate JSON structure that best represents the tasks and their associated details.  
- Include fields such as `task_name`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, etc.  
- The list should be an array of task objects.  
- Ensure the JSON structure is correctly formatted and represents the tasks as actionable items.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

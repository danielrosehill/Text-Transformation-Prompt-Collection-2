Reformat the following text into a software research statement.  
- Start with an introduction that defines the problem or area of interest in software development.  
- Explain the context and why the software solution is necessary.  
- Summarize previous research or solutions in the area and how they relate to the current proposal.  
- Clearly define the research objectives or hypotheses.  
- Conclude with the expected outcomes and potential impact of the research.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

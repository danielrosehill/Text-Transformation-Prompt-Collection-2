Reformat the following text into a JSON calendar entry in ICS format.  
- Convert the text into a properly structured ICS format, ensuring all essential fields are included:  
  - `BEGIN:VEVENT`, `SUMMARY`, `DTSTART`, `DTEND`, `LOCATION`, `DESCRIPTION`, `END:VEVENT`  
- Output the result as a JSON object, with the key "event" containing the ICS data as a string.  
- Ensure the date and time formats are correctly represented in the ICS structure (e.g., `DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:20230421T100000`).


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

Reformat the following text into code generation instructions for software.  
- Start by clearly defining the purpose or goal of the software.  
- Specify the main features and functionalities that need to be implemented.  
- Break the instructions down into steps or functions that should be created.  
- Include any specific programming languages, frameworks, or libraries to be used.  
- End with any additional requirements such as testing, documentation, or deployment details.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

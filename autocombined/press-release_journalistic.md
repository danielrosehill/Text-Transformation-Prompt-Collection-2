- Start with a headline that summarizes the news in a clear, attention-grabbing way.  
- Include a subheadline for further context or details.  
- Follow with the body, including the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the announcement.  
- Ensure the tone is professional and objective.  
- End with a contact section and company boilerplate.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

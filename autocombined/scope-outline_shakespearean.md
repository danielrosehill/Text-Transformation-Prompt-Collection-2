Reformat the following text into a statement of scope.  
- Start with an introduction outlining the project or initiative.  
- Clearly define the objectives and goals of the project.  
- List the specific deliverables, milestones, and timelines.  
- Define any exclusions or limitations to clarify the scope.  
- Conclude with any expected outcomes or next steps.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

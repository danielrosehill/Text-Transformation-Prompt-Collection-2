Reformat the following text into a note to self.  
- Start with a brief heading or reminder, like “Reminder” or “Note to self.”  
- Write in a casual and direct tone, as if you're reminding yourself of something important.  
- Keep the text short, actionable, and clear, focusing on what you need to remember or do.  
- End with a positive or motivating statement if applicable.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeare’s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

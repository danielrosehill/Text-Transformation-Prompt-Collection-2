Reformat the following text into a JSON to-do list.  
- Think of an appropriate JSON structure that best represents the tasks and their associated details.  
- Include fields such as `task_name`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, etc.  
- The list should be an array of task objects.  
- Ensure the JSON structure is correctly formatted and represents the tasks as actionable items.


Apply the following style:
- Use direct, clear, and authoritative language to convey your message.  
- Avoid hedging or uncertaintyâ€”make the statement or request strong and unambiguous.  
- Ensure the language is firm but still respectful, emphasizing your position with confidence.  
- Remove any unnecessary qualifiers or conditional language that may weaken the message.

Reformat the following text into code generation instructions for software.  
- Start by clearly defining the purpose or goal of the software.  
- Specify the main features and functionalities that need to be implemented.  
- Break the instructions down into steps or functions that should be created.  
- Include any specific programming languages, frameworks, or libraries to be used.  
- End with any additional requirements such as testing, documentation, or deployment details.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

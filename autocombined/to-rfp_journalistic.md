- Start with an introduction outlining the purpose of the RFP and the problem or need to be addressed.  
- Provide background information on the company or project.  
- Clearly define the scope of work, deliverables, and timeline.  
- Specify any requirements for proposals, including qualifications, pricing, and terms.  
- Conclude with instructions for submitting the proposal, including the deadline and contact information.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

Reformat the following text into general documentation.  
- Start with a clear title and an introductory section outlining what the documentation covers.  
- Organize the content into sections, breaking down complex information into digestible parts.  
- Use bullet points, numbered lists, or diagrams to clarify details.  
- Keep the tone formal, clear, and concise, making it easy for someone to understand and apply the information.  
- End with a conclusion or summary, and include any further references if needed.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

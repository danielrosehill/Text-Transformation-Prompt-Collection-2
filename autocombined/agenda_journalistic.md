Reformat the following text into a meeting agenda.  
- Start with the meeting date, time, and location (if applicable).  
- List the main topics or items to be discussed, each as a numbered or bulleted item.  
- For each item, include a brief description or goal of the discussion.  
- Include time allocations for each topic if applicable.  
- Ensure the format is clear, organized, and easy to follow.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

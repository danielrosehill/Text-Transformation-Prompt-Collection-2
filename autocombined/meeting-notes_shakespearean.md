Reformat the following text into a summary of meeting notes.  
- Start with the date and time of the meeting.  
- List key discussion points, decisions made, and action items.  
- If applicable, include who is responsible for each action item and the deadlines.  
- Ensure the format is clear and easy to follow, with bullet points for each main point.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

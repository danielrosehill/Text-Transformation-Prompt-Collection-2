Reformat the following text into a system prompt for an AI assistant.  
- Start with: "You are a friendly assistant who helps with [specific task or function]."  
- Define the assistant's role clearly, outlining what it should focus on.  
- Include instructions on how the assistant should respond, such as being polite, concise, and clear.  
- End with a reminder that the assistant should always prioritize helping the user.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

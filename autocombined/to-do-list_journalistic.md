Reformat the following text into a clear and actionable to-do list.  
- Use bullet points or numbered items to break down tasks.  
- Each task should be short and concise, starting with an action verb.  
- Ensure the tasks are ordered logically if needed, from most important to least.  
- Avoid unnecessary details, and focus on the key action items.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

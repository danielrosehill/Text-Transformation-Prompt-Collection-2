Reformat the following text into a JSON calendar entry in ICS format.  
- Convert the text into a properly structured ICS format, ensuring all essential fields are included:  
  - `BEGIN:VEVENT`, `SUMMARY`, `DTSTART`, `DTEND`, `LOCATION`, `DESCRIPTION`, `END:VEVENT`  
- Output the result as a JSON object, with the key "event" containing the ICS data as a string.  
- Ensure the date and time formats are correctly represented in the ICS structure (e.g., `DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:20230421T100000`).


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

Reformat the following text into a JSON to-do list.  
- Think of an appropriate JSON structure that best represents the tasks and their associated details.  
- Include fields such as `task_name`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, etc.  
- The list should be an array of task objects.  
- Ensure the JSON structure is correctly formatted and represents the tasks as actionable items.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

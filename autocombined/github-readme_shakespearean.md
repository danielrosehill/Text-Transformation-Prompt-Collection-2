Reformat the following text into a README file for a GitHub repository.  
- Start with the project title and a short description of what it does.  
- Include installation instructions, dependencies, and how to run the software.  
- Provide examples of how to use the software, including command-line arguments or function calls.  
- Include any necessary configuration steps, if applicable.  
- End with a section on contributing, licensing, and contact information.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

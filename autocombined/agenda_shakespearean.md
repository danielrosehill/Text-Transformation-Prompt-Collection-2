Reformat the following text into a meeting agenda.  
- Start with the meeting date, time, and location (if applicable).  
- List the main topics or items to be discussed, each as a numbered or bulleted item.  
- For each item, include a brief description or goal of the discussion.  
- Include time allocations for each topic if applicable.  
- Ensure the format is clear, organized, and easy to follow.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

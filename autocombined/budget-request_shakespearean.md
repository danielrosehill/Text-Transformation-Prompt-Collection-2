Reformat the following text into a budget request.  
- Start with an introduction explaining the purpose of the request.  
- List the specific items or categories that need funding, with clear explanations.  
- Include estimated costs for each item or category.  
- Provide a total amount requested and any justification for the budget needs.

Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

Reformat the following text into a Request for Proposal (RFP).  
- Start with an introduction outlining the purpose of the RFP and the problem or need to be addressed.  
- Provide background information on the company or project.  
- Clearly define the scope of work, deliverables, and timeline.  
- Specify any requirements for proposals, including qualifications, pricing, and terms.  
- Conclude with instructions for submitting the proposal, including the deadline and contact information.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

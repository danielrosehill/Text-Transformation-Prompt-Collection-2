Reformat the following text into a contract negotiation response.  
- Start by acknowledging the terms of the contract.  
- Clearly state any areas of disagreement or concern and provide reasons.  
- Suggest alternative terms or conditions, if necessary.  
- End by expressing a willingness to discuss further or reach a mutually beneficial agreement.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

Reformat the following text into a classified listing.  
- Start with a clear and concise title that highlights the main item or service.  
- Provide key details in bullet points or short sentences, including important characteristics like price, size, condition, or any relevant features.  
- Use an engaging tone, making it clear why someone would want to purchase or inquire about the listing.  
- Include contact information and any specific instructions for interested buyers or parties.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.

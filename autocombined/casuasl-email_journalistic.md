Reformat the following text into a casual email message.  
- Start with a friendly salutation, such as "Hi [Recipient's Name]," or "Hey [Recipient's Name],".  
- Ensure the tone is informal and conversational while still maintaining clarity.  
- Improve the text for readability and flow.  
- End with a casual sign-off, such as "Cheers," or "Best," followed by "Daniel" as the signature.


Apply the following style:
- Write in a clear, objective, and fact-based tone, similar to news reporting.  
- Start with the most important details (who, what, when, where, why) and then provide supporting information.  
- Keep the language simple and direct, focusing on clarity and accuracy.  
- Avoid personal opinions or overly emotional language; focus instead on reporting the facts.

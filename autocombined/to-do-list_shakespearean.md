Reformat the following text into a clear and actionable to-do list.  
- Use bullet points or numbered items to break down tasks.  
- Each task should be short and concise, starting with an action verb.  
- Ensure the tasks are ordered logically if needed, from most important to least.  
- Avoid unnecessary details, and focus on the key action items.


Apply the following style:
- Use archaic vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for the time period (e.g., "thee," "thou," "art," "dost").  
- Maintain the original meaning of the text, but adjust the tone to match the grandeur and formality of Shakespeareâ€™s language.  
- Where possible, incorporate poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and metaphor to enhance the stylistic quality.  
- Ensure the flow feels natural to the Shakespearean style while still retaining clarity.
